## What it does

thebookdex is a fully on-chain decentralized exchange running on the Vara Network. It combines two trading models in a single Sails program:

**A) Central Limit Orderbook** — Exchange-style trading
- Place limit buy/sell orders at a specific price
- Execute market orders against the best available price
- Supports BTC, ETH, VARA — all quoted in USD
- Automatic on-chain order matching

**B) Automated Market Maker (AMM)** — Uniswap-style liquidity pools
- Create liquidity pools for any asset pair
- Add/remove liquidity as an LP provider
- Swap tokens with 0.3% fee using constant product (x·y=k) formula
- Earn fees proportional to LP share

**Oracle integration** — Live prices fetched from the [VaraBridge](https://github.com/Oltking/vara-trinity) oracle via cross-program call. Arbitrage opportunities between DEX price and oracle price are displayed in real time.

**Agent-to-agent interface** — Other Sails programs can call `CallAgentService` to route messages through thebookdex, making it composable in multi-agent pipelines. See [skills.md](./skills.md) for the full integration guide.

## Contract architecture

```
Program (thebook)
  ├── OrderbookService (orderbook.rs)
  │     Join · PlaceLimit · MarketBuy · MarketSell · CancelOrder
  │     GetOrderbook · GetPortfolio · GetTrades · GetLeaderboard
  │     GetLivePrice (→ VaraBridge cross-program) · CallAgentService
  │
  └── AmmService (amm.rs)
        CreatePool · AddLiquidity · RemoveLiquidity · Swap
        ListPools · GetPool · GetLpPosition
```

Shared state: `DexState` (state.rs) — balances, orders, pools, trades, LP positions in a single `RefCell<DexState>`.

## Agent-to-agent integration

Any Sails program on Vara can call thebookdex directly. See [skills.md](./skills.md) for the full interface documentation including payload encoding, call patterns, and example Rust code.

Quick example — place a market buy from another program:

```rust
let mut payload = "Orderbook".encode();
payload.extend("MarketBuy".encode());
payload.extend((Asset::BTC, 100_000u64).encode()); // buy 0.001 BTC

msg::send_for_reply_as::<RawPayload, SailsReply<Result<String, ContractError>>>(
    THEBOOKDEX_PID, RawPayload(payload), gas, 0,
)?.await?.0
```

## Frontend

Five views, fully responsive (mobile · tablet · desktop):

| View | Description |
|---|---|
| **Trade** | 4-panel trading terminal: chart · orderbook · order entry · recent trades |
| **Swap** | AMM swap with real-time constant-product output calculation |
| **Pools** | Create pools, add/remove liquidity, view LP positions |
| **Portfolio** | Balances, net worth, open orders with cancel |
| **Leaderboard** | Top traders ranked by net worth |

## Building & testing

```bash
# Smart contract
cargo build --release          # builds WASM binary
cargo test --release           # runs all gtest integration tests

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                    # development server (localhost:5173)
npm run build                  # TypeScript check + production build
```

---

## Deployment

The frontend is deployed to Vercel. To deploy your own instance:

1. Fork this repo
2. Update `frontend/src/consts.ts` with your program ID
3. Connect the `frontend/` folder to Vercel
4. Optionally add a Vercel KV store for shared oracle price caching
